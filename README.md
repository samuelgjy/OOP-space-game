# Object Oriented Principles - Space Game
# Prerequisites:
- LibGDX
- Java

# Introduction
In this game, the player will get the chance to embark on an exciting space adventure that will 
take them through the wonders of the galaxy and beyond. They will encounter the forces of 
gravity, dodge dangerous asteroids, and experience how it is like to travel through a wormhole.
Moreover, they will also learn about the importance of oxygen and other possible resources 
necessary for life in space.


# Game Engine Layer
The Game Engine Layer comprises six distinct sub-packages, each of which is accountable for 
managing a particular category of game components. These components are responsible for 
supervising specific aspects of the game engine's functionality.

- AssetsManager
- ScreenManager
- EntityManager
- CollisionManager
- BehaviourManager
- InputManager

# Game Logic
In this game, the objective is to survive as long as possible in space while evading space 
phenomena such as asteroids which can reduce the player’s health in terms of oxygen, or
black holes which can kill the player. The player must hence collect oxygen to prevent it from 
hitting 0 as it depletes naturally at a fixed rate, even if the player hasn't collided with any of 
these dangers. It is important to be strategic and navigate through the vast expanse of space 
to collect the oxygen it requires and avoid the dangers that could shorten the player’s survival 
time.
